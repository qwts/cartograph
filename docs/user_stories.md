### US-0001 — Add a repo set and define system topology
- **Actor:** Engineer
- **As a** engineer **I want** to add 1..N GitHub repos and declare which repos form one system **so that** the engine treats them as a single analyzable whole.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0001** Given valid GitHub App/PAT auth, when I add a repo URL, then it is cloned read-only and listed with commit SHA.
- **AC-0002** Given a multi-repo set, when I edit `cartograph.system.toml`, then declared layer hints and channel identities are applied at ingest.
- **AC-0003** Given an unauthorized repo, when I add it, then I get a clear auth-failure with remediation and no partial clone.
- **AC-0049** Given any completed ingest, when its summary is shown, then TypeScript and Terraform each report source-file, node, and edge counts including explicit zeros.
- **AC-0050** Given a non-empty graph, when I request a clear and confirm the warning, then all graph facts are removed while durable job history remains intact.
- **Security:** Tokens stored in OS keychain; never logged; least-privilege App scopes.
- **Performance:** Shallow/sparse clone; 1 GB repo clones within bounded progress feedback.

### US-0002 — Deterministic extraction of server-side facts (TS/Python/Go)
- **Actor:** Engine
- **As a** engineer **I want** import/call graphs, endpoints, and data access extracted statically **so that** server facts are Confirmed without inference.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** In-Progress
- **AC-0004** Given a TS repo, when ingested, then endpoints (method/path/handler) are extracted via the framework adapter and marked Confirmed.
- **AC-0005** Given typed TS, when building call edges, then intra-procedural edges are complete and inter-procedural edges resolve where types permit.
- **AC-0006** Given any extracted fact, when inspected, then it carries provenance (file/span/commit, tier, extractor_id).
- **AC-0053** Given Python that import-proves FastAPI or Flask, when the repo is ingested, then Confirmed T0 File/Symbol/IMPORTS/CALLS facts plus literal Endpoint/HANDLES registrations are recovered with exact evidence, directory-proven imported calls are joined deterministically, lookalike framework calls are ignored, and the ingest summary reports Python separately.
- **AC-0054** Given Go that import-proves `net/http`, chi, or gin, when the repo is ingested, then Confirmed T0 File/Symbol/IMPORTS/CALLS facts plus literal Endpoint registrations are recovered with exact evidence, local-package calls and handlers are joined deterministically, unresolved handler expressions retain the Endpoint with an explicit HANDLES Gap, dynamic routes and lookalike registrations are ignored, files requiring an undeclared build target are excluded, server-only layer hints are honored, and the ingest summary reports Go separately.
- **Security:** No code leaves device at T0.
- **Performance:** Incremental tree-sitter parse; re-parse only changed files by `content_hash`.

### US-0003 — IaC resource graph + cloud capability resolution (Terraform/Pulumi/AWS)
- **Actor:** Engine
- **As a** engineer **I want** a deterministic resource graph with cloud-capability edges **so that** infra/cloud topology is Confirmed.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0007** Given Terraform HCL, when parsed, then a resource DAG is built from interpolation references.
- **AC-0008** Given AWS resources, when resolved against the Capability Registry, then TRIGGERS/ROUTES/GRANTS edges are emitted deterministically.
- **AC-0009** Given Terraform state/plan JSON, when available, then T1 enrichment supersedes ambiguous T0 refs (observed provenance).
- **AC-0043** Given an API Gateway v1 integration with direct resource references, when resolved against the Capability Registry, then a Confirmed ROUTES edge links the REST API to its integration target.
- **AC-0044** Given a Lambda permission with direct resource references, when resolved against the Capability Registry, then a Confirmed TRIGGERS edge links its source ARN to the Lambda function.
- **AC-0045** Given Lambda@Edge associations nested under default or ordered CloudFront cache behaviors, when resolved against the Capability Registry, then Confirmed TRIGGERS edges link the distribution to every referenced Lambda function.
- **AC-0046** Given an EventBridge Pipe with direct resource references, when resolved against the Capability Registry, then a Confirmed TRIGGERS edge links its source to its target.
- **AC-0047** Given an IAM policy that references an `aws_iam_policy_document` defined in the same extraction, when its statement resources are resolvable, then Confirmed GRANTS edges target those resources with actions and evidence from the document; an absent or unresolved document target remains explicit.
- **AC-0048** Given a Terraform module with a literal local source confined to the ingest root, when extracted, then its resources and internal edges are instantiated under the `module.<name>.` address prefix recursively and deterministically; remote, escaping, symlink-escaping, or cyclic sources remain explicit leaf modules.
- **AC-0051** Given TypeScript that import-proves an AWS Pulumi constructor, when a resource with a literal logical name is parsed, then a Confirmed T0 Resource plus REFERENCES/DEPENDS_ON (including `parent`/`dependsOn`) and applicable shared Capability Registry edges are emitted; lookalike constructors without a Pulumi import produce no IaC facts.
- **AC-0052** Given a Pulumi stack export or preview JSON artifact declared as `pulumi_json`, when it is ingested, then matching T0 Pulumi resources gain separate Dynamic/Confirmed observed inputs, outputs, URN, and evidence while Pulumi secret wrappers are redacted and unmatched observations never fabricate T0 resources.
- **Security:** IAM GRANTS feed the security view; secrets in state are redacted.
- **Performance:** Registry lookups O(1) per resource type.

### US-0004 — Event graph with channel-identity stitching
- **Actor:** Engine
- **As a** engineer **I want** producers and consumers linked by channel identity **so that** flows cross service and repo boundaries.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0010** Given a literal channel id on both sides, when matched, then a Confirmed PUBLISHES/SUBSCRIBES edge is created.
- **AC-0011** Given a channel id from a present config/env file, when resolved, then the edge is Confirmed via the config resolver.
- **AC-0012** Given a runtime-computed channel id, when unresolved at T0, then the hop escalates and, if still unresolved, emits a Gap with reason.
- **Security:** —
- **Performance:** Channel index keyed by identity for O(1) match.

### US-0005 — Client-side interaction graph (React first)
- **Actor:** Engine
- **As a** engineer **I want** screens, components, and data-fetch call sites extracted **so that** flows are anchored at user actions.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0013** Given a React/Next repo, when ingested, then Screen/Component nodes and FETCHES edges to endpoints are created.
- **AC-0014** Given a data-fetch call site, when the endpoint is resolvable, then FETCHES is Confirmed; otherwise it escalates.

### US-0006 — Deterministic end-to-end flow tracer
- **Actor:** Engine
- **As a** engineer **I want** cross-layer flows traced T0-first with explicit gaps **so that** flows are trustworthy.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0015** Given a trigger, when traced, then each hop resolves at the lowest possible tier and records its tier.
- **AC-0016** Given any unresolved hop, when no tier resolves it, then a Gap node truncates that branch (no silent completion).
- **AC-0017** Given a completed trace, when scored, then flow_status ∈ {Verified, Partial, Inferred} per the scoring rule.
- **Security:** —
- **Performance:** Path queries bounded; long flows stream incrementally to UI.

### US-0007 — Provenance and confidence on every fact
- **Actor:** Engine
- **As a** engineer **I want** every node/edge tagged with tier + confidence + evidence **so that** integrity is enforced.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0018** Given any fact, when stored, then it has {tier, confidence_tier, evidence[], extractor_id, content_hash}.
- **AC-0019** Given a T2/T3 producer, when it runs, then it cannot overwrite or upgrade a T0/T1 fact (R-INT-1).
- **AC-0020** Given an agent (T3), when it acts, then it can only propose edges/annotations with cited evidence; it cannot write T0/T1 (R-INT-3).

### US-0008 — Semantic tier with eval gating
- **Actor:** Engine
- **As a** engineer **I want** semantic matching gated by paired evals **so that** inferred links meet a precision floor.
- **Priority:** Should · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0021** Given real ingested unresolved channel or call hops, when T2 runs, then IaC-backed channel resources and repository symbols are eligible targets and proposals are marked InferredStrong with evidence.
- **AC-0022** Given a labeled eval set, when T2 is measured, then proposals below the precision floor are excluded from `best-effort` exports.
- **Security:** Embeddings computed locally by default.
- **Performance:** ANN index query sub-100ms typical.

### US-0009 — Bounded agentic tier with egress firewall
- **Actor:** Engine
- **As a** engineer **I want** agents to propose resolutions only, with per-tier cloud opt-in **so that** privacy and integrity hold.
- **Priority:** Should · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0023** Given a Local-only policy, when T3 needs a cloud provider, then it hard-fails closed (no silent egress).
- **AC-0024** Given cloud opt-in, when an agent runs, then the consent dialog shows the exact span-level payload leaving the device.
- **AC-0025** Given an agent proposal, when accepted/rejected, then the decision persists and re-applies on re-ingest.
- **AC-0055** Given a tier whose provider is switched to cloud in Settings, when standing consent has not been granted, then the full disclosure (provider, pinned model id, endpoint, per-token pricing, lane caveats) is shown before consent is recordable and no cloud call is possible; if no disclosure is available, no consent affordance is offered at all.
- **AC-0056** Given standing cloud consent, when it is revoked, the tier is disabled, or the tier's provider leaves cloud, then the derived egress policy and the status-bar egress summary immediately return to local-only.
- **Security:** Default-deny cloud egress; secret redaction on payloads.

### US-0010 — Atlas graph canvas with confidence overlay
- **Actor:** Engineer
- **As a** engineer **I want** to explore the unified graph with layer filters and tier coloring **so that** I can see what is confirmed vs inferred vs gapped.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0026** Given the graph, when I filter by layer, then only that layer's nodes/edges render.
- **AC-0027** Given the confidence overlay, when active, then nodes/edges are colored by tier and Gaps are flagged.
- **AC-0028** Given a node, when selected, then the evidence panel shows file/span/commit with read-only jump-to-source.
- **Security:** Source view is read-only (NG1).
- **Performance:** Canvas remains interactive at 10k+ nodes (Cytoscape.js).

### US-0011 — Flow Inspector with explicit gaps
- **Actor:** Engineer
- **As a** engineer **I want** to view a traced flow as a sequence with per-hop tier badges and explicit gap cards **so that** I trust the flow.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0029** Given a trigger, when I open Flow Inspector, then the flow renders as a sequence (React Flow + Mermaid) with tier badges.
- **AC-0030** Given a Gap hop, when shown, then it appears as an "unresolved" card with reason and attempted escalation.
- **AC-0031** Given the export toggle, when set to `verified-only`, then InferredWeak hops are excluded.

### US-0012 — Spec Workbench, curation, and export
- **Actor:** Engineer
- **As a** engineer **I want** to review compiled artifacts, accept/reject inferred items, and export **so that** I get an official, trustworthy spec.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0032** Given compiled artifacts, when viewed, then every assertion shows inline provenance.
- **AC-0033** Given an inferred item, when I accept/reject/annotate, then the decision persists and survives re-ingest via content_hash.
- **AC-0034** Given export, when run, then it honors R-INT-5 (`verified-only` vs `best-effort`) and includes Gap + Drift registers.
- **AC-0035** Given the full set, when exported, then it produces user stories, US-TM, flow dossiers, resource topology as Markdown with fenced Mermaid plus provenance, a data model retaining READS/WRITES/MAPS_TO relations that terminate at DataEntity, ADRs, Gap + Drift registers, and mapped security findings.

### US-0013 — ADR recovery and drift detection
- **Actor:** Engine
- **As a** engineer **I want** found and recovered ADRs linked to governed targets, with conflicts surfaced **so that** decisions and drift are visible.
- **Priority:** Should · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0036** Given existing Markdown ADR/RFC files, when parsed or re-ingested, then explicit `Governs:` or exact backtick target ids link to existing full-system graph targets as Confirmed facts, including targets from another repo, while removed declarations and deleted ADR files remove their prior links and found nodes.
- **AC-0037** Given evidence-backed channel architecture, when recovered ADRs are drafted, then they are marked recovered/inferred, cite the producing graph evidence, remain curatable, and cannot survive rejection of their supporting facts.
- **AC-0038** Given a found ADR with an explicit `Forbids:` edge constraint, when governed code conflicts, then a confidence-preserving finding appears in the Drift register mapped to the offending edge and any containing flow, unless that supporting edge was rejected.

### US-0014 — Determinism and re-ingest idempotency
- **Actor:** Engine
- **As a** engineer **I want** re-ingesting the same commit to yield an identical graph **so that** outputs are reproducible.
- **Priority:** Must · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0039** Given the same commit and inputs, when re-ingested, then the ordered T0 node/edge identity plus content-hash snapshot is identical and unchanged graph facts are not rewritten.
- **AC-0040** Given a changed or deleted TS/TSX/Terraform file, when re-ingested in the same process, then only new or byte-changed per-file extraction contexts are reparsed, unchanged contexts are reused by source hash, deterministic repository-wide joins are refreshed, and stale facts are removed.

- **Priority:** Should · **Status:** Done
- **AC-0041** Given an endpoint with an explicit negative auth fact, when projected, then it is listed as a cited security finding mapped to US-0015/AC-0041; missing auth evidence alone never asserts unauthenticated status.
- **AC-0042** Given an IAM `GRANTS` edge with a wildcard action or literal wildcard resource scope, when analyzed, then a confidence-preserving finding lists the exact actions and resource scope and maps to US-0015/AC-0042.
